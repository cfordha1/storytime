Chris: 
Last week, just as I was leaving for the Flughafen to catch my flight to Berlin, I realized I had forgotten to pack some of my German clothes. 
Connor:
I thought about turning around, but suddenly I saw a Kopfkino of arriving late and missing my flight, so I decided to leave them behind.
Chris: 
But while in my BMW, I just couldn't stop thinking about how I had to leave behind my lederhose. 
Justin: 
I knew when i landed in Frankfurt, my grandma would be disappointed that I wasnt wearing my Dirndel for her.
Garrett:
Right then I peered off almost as if it was a luftschloss, I saw a beautiful women who looked just like schneewittchen.
Justin:
Sadly, I was no prince, instead I looked like Gauss and was too nervous to talk to her, so I continued on my way.
